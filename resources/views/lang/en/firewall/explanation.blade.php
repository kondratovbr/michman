        By default the firewall on your server is configured to
        <strong>deny</strong> all incoming connections and
        <strong>allow</strong> all outgoing connection.
    </p>
    <p>
        Opening a port will <strong>allow</strong> all incoming connections to that port.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you don't provide a "From IP" address,
        the specified port will be open for connections from any IP address on the Internet.
