{{--TODO: ICON! This is a temporary spinner. The actual one is "fad fa-spinner-third" and is found in a paid FontAwesome version. I should pay for it and use it. I also have some other places that require paid FA icons. And check if the wobble is too big - FA has an SVG+JS version that they say helps with it.--}}

<x-icon {{ $attributes->class([
    '',
